# Game Design: The Triangle Loop Economy

## Core Concept
The game economy revolves around a "Triangle Loop" where resources are generated, converted, and amplified, while being constrained by a global Happiness mechanic.

### 1. The Triangle Loop
1.  **Engineers (Source)**:
    *   Produce **Dev Points (Tech)**.
    *   *Constraint*: Their **Efficiency** is heavily dependent on **Happiness**.
2.  **Sales (Converter)**:
    *   Convert **Dev Points** into **Money ($)**.
    *   *Cost*: Hiring Sales units reduces **Global Happiness** (-1 per unit).
3.  **PMs (Amplifier)**:
    *   Amplify Tech production (Boost Efficiency/Output).
    *   *Cost*: Hiring PMs significantly reduces **Global Happiness** (-2 per unit).

### 2. The Happiness Constraint
*   **Base Happiness**: 100.
*   **Global Penalty**: Non-engineer units (Sales, PM) drag down the company culture.
    *   Sales: -1 Happiness
    *   PM: -2 Happiness
*   **Impact**: Lower Happiness reduces Engineer Efficiency exponentially.
    *   Formula: `Efficiency = (Happiness / 100)^2` (Applied to Engineers ONLY).

### 3. The Sink (Restoration)
To maintain the loop, players must spend **Money** (generated by Sales) on **Facilities** or **Policies** to restore Happiness.
*   **Pantry**: Restores Happiness to nearby Engineers (+4).
*   **Plant**: Small Happiness boost (+2).
*   **Policies**: Can trade Money for Happiness (Competitive Salary) or Output (Responsibility System).

## Policies
Policies act as global levers to shift the balance.

| Policy | Level | Effect | Cost |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Responsibility System** | 1-5 | **R&D Output +20%**, **Happiness -1** per level. | $5k base |
| **Competitive Salary** | 1-5 | **Salary +50%**, **Happiness +20** per level. | $2k base |
| **Expansion** | 0-5 | Increases Grid Size (Starts 6x6, +2 Ring/Level). | $10k base |

## Unit Balance
*   **Jr. Engineer**: $100 ($10/day). +20 Tech.
*   **Sr. Engineer**: $300 ($50/day). +80 Tech.
*   **Sales**: $150 ($8/day). Converts Tech -> Money. **-1 Global Happiness**.
*   **PM**: $250 ($20/day). Amplifies Tech. **-2 Global Happiness**.
*   **Server Rack**: $500 ($10/day). +50% Neighbor Efficiency.
